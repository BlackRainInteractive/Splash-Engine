Splash Engine - Revision 3
=============

A fast &amp; powerful OpenGL game engine, written in C++.
Revision 3 is the latest iteration of the engine, and also the version that is publicly avaliable.

While there is no documentation at this time, there is a simple example that can be used to get started.
It is also in very early development, and is far from being feature complete.

It has been tested on Windows and Linux (Arch). In theory, it should also run on OSX, but it hasn't been tested.

Also, no dependencies are included. You will need to download them yourself.
The dependencies are listed below.
